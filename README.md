## Time Series Analysis of the S&P 500 Index. 🎃

Languages and Libraries: `Python`🐍 (`Matplotlib`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`) 

Hey! 👋🏾 

This project will analyse the **S&P 500** data, forecast future trends and apply quantitative techniques to evaluate trading strategies.
This is useful for financial forecasting, portfolio management and also, risk assessment.
Below, I've outlined the steps of this project. The workflow and folders are towards the end, hope you enjoy reading :)


---

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: 🤏
*Skills: API Integration, Data Handling, Handling of Messy Data, Data Modelling Preparation, Statistical Testing*

- In this project, data will be obtained from the API `yfinance`. You can find relevant stock data from various time frames, and it is widely available for anybody to use.
- A **summary** will be produced, where you can observe the head of the dataset, it's time range and any relevant variables.
- Any missing values, outliers and anomalies will be identified and rectified. 
- Using `NumPy`, I will calculate and print daily/weekly/yearly **logarithmic returns**, this helps us to see the average rate of return, day by day, weeky by week, and year on year for quantitative analysis within the `Results` folder. I will also compute the formula for **raw daily volatility**.
- This will similarly be replicated for **moving averages** (EMA given Quantitative Focus) and I will use daily volatility within the later stage of EDA.
- Then, I shall perform a **stationarity** test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) to ensure stationarity.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis 👀
*Skills: Data Visualisation, Insight Extraction*

- Here, I will create time series visual plots of stock prices, their returns and key features. We will plot the **logarithmic daily returns, moving averages and raw daily volatility** calculated in the previous part. All done with Matplotlib.
- Correlation heatmaps of the variables will also be produced. This is done using `Matplotlib`
- This time series will furthermore be decomposed into trends, seasonalities and residuals using libraries such as `statsmodels`.


### 3. Time Series Modelling 🎯
*Skills: Statistical Modelling, Predictive Analysis*

- I will use ARIMA for mean forecasting and GARCH for volatility. I'll do model fitting and parameter tuning, alongside calculating diagnostics such as **ACF, PACF plots and residual analysis**
- **Mean Squared Errors, Mean Absolute Errors and R-Squared** values will be calculated. As studied within my Econometric classes, these metrics are used to evaluate model fit.
- I will compare models and explain their results and link them to their real world relevance within Quantitative Finance.

### 4. Fore-casting 🌦
*Skills: Forecasting, Real-world application*

- Creation of short-term and long-term forecasts: the trained models will generate predictions.
- As studied within my Econometrics modules, I'll calculate confidence intervals for forecasts and discuss potential uncertainty.
- Then, I'll link these predictions to potential trading and investment decisions within Quantitative Finance/Trading.

### 5. Back-testing and Strategy Development 🔁
*Skills: Quantitative Strategy Implementations, Performance Evaluations*

- I aim to create a mean-reversion strategy based upon the moving average (EMA, given it is financial data) of predicted prices.
- I'll simulate the strategy on historical data, taking into consideration entry/exit rules alongside transaction costs and slippage.
- Performance Metrics include: Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, Annualised Returns and Win/Loss Ratios.

### 6. Risk Management 🧐
*Skills: Financial Risk Management, Portfolio Optimisation*

- Stop-loss and take-profit rules will be demonstrating and shown to understands its impact on strategy returns.
- Position Sizing: Using volatility-based position sizing or fixed-percentage risk.
- Simulate performance under extreme market consitions, like with the 2008 Financial Crash
